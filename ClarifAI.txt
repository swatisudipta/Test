ClarifAI:

Why:
Challenges in translating the ambiguous business requirements into actionable outcomes​

Large effort spend from requirements to test cases​

Misinterpretation of requirements across teams.​

Redundant grooming and clarification cycles​

Need for improving traceability and Testability

What:
GenAI-powered solution that transforms the requirement engineering phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).​

.Eliminate the first-mile inefficiency in SDLC by automatically converting requirements documents into user stories, test cases and BDD scripts​

Ensure the journey from business vision to working software is accurate, fast and test ready

How:
Automated Requirement Extraction and Validation : Extract, Classify functional and nonfunctional  requirements from BRD  and validate the same using with the help of different agents.​

User Story Generation:  Converts the requirements from agile ready user stories and integrate the same with Jira​

Test Case and BDD Scripts generation : Create test cases from user stories and gherkin-based test scenarios​

Creation of Traceability : Create traceability from requirements to user stories and test cases


DevXcelerate

Why

Developers struggle with tech stack discovery and build dependency
mapping​

Manual pipeline creation is time-consuming and error-prone​

Inconsistent quality across DevOps stages leads to deployment
inefficiencies​

Existing tools lack the intelligence to automatically generate or adapt
pipeline configurations according to the project specification​

Need of specialized expertise in various platforms like Azure DevOps,
Jenkins, Gitlab CI​

Cross-platform pipeline conversion lacks standardization


What

Powering DevOps with Generative Intelligence​

Intelligent Codebase Insights: Detects tech sack, uncovers dependencies, and
recommends pipeline stages-reducing guesswork and accelerating the setup​

Adaptive Pipeline Generation: Automatically produces environment-specific
CI/CD pipelines based on tech stack, dependencies and developer preference​

Cross-Platform Transformation: By drastically reducing manual effort, the
platform accelerates pipeline development and boosts overall team
productivity​

Agent-led & Human-in-the-loop Pipeline Optimization:   Autonomous
agent interactions between RefinerAgent and DevOpsExpertAgent,
coupled with human-in-the-loop input, ensures continuous optimization
of generated pipeline code. User input is prioritized at any stage
,allowing seamless human intervention and tailored enhancements​
