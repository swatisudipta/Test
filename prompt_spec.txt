                        Convert User Input into the pipeline specification.
                        
                    Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
                                        
                    ### Instructions
                        - Extract all step,task,script from the given input file and present them in the structured format output.
                        -For each step/task/script , a stage needs to be created in output json.
                        - Ensure that all step/task/script of the input files are included in the output.
                        - Repeat this format for all tep/task/script and tasks in the input file. 
                        - If the input file includes additional steps ensure they are captured accurately in the output. 
                        - Do not omit any step that present in input file.Do not miss any steps.
                        - Maintain the correct sequence of tasks as given in the input.
                        -If a particular stage/task/script is not present in input file, then it will not be present in the output.
                   
                    
                    ###output
                         The output should:
                        - Have specification of pipeline code in json structured format
                        - Ensure the code specification replicates all stages from the input pipeline.
                        - Maintain the same build and deployment logic.
                        - If there are multiple stages present, Join them sequentially as the whole output should be a single specification file.
